Config Files
---
The most important file is config/marvin.srdf. This file contains the definition of the kinematic chains and gripper, named poses defined in joint space and a collision matrix which permanently disables collisions between objects which always collide to improve collision detection performance.

Update collision matrix after the urdf has changed
---
The config/marvin.srdf is normally generated by the moveit setup assistant. But if there are only small changes in the urdf it's often easier to edit it by hand.
